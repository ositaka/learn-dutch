## How to write the date in Dutch?

The standard numeric date format in Dutch, like in most of Europe, is:

> [**day**] &nbsp; [**month**] &nbsp; [**year**]

This means a Dutch speaker would write "_Tuesday, March 12, 2019_" as "**dinsdag 12 maart 2019**".

If you wanted to abbreviate it, you could write "**di. 12 mrt. 2019**", and in numerical format, that would be "**12-03-2019**" (or, with slashes, "**12/03/2019**").
