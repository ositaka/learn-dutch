## Welcome

Here you can find all the documents I've been studying and writing, to help me to achieve my goal of becoming a Dutch speaker. It will be a long journey! But by making this content publicly available, I hope it can help you as well in your learning journey.

In my personal approach, I start to watch a video or any source of Dutch content and make my own notes with on a sheet of paper. From there on, I make that content "digital" on this platform; on this step, I still fix a few typos and I have another chance to memorize those words. Then, I still read everything again, and I have another opportunity to get that content.

I made this platform for myself. I really believe it will help me when I need to get a few dialog examples to start a "face to face" conversation in person. It's simple as getting out the smartphone and looking into my Dutch notes, in my hand.
